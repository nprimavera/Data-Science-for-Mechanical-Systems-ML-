        "In *Part 2*, your task is to develop a model that decides the agent's next action based on environmental observations. The agent has three possible actions: moving up, left, or right. The objective is to navigate the agent towards the goal square, which is marked in red in the figures provided above.\n",

There are various methods for training such policies, and we will explore many of these techniques in the Reinforcement Learning section of the course.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that learning a policy can also be approached as a Supervised Learning problem. In this scenario, you will receive labeled examples from an \"expert\". Each example will include a tuple in the form of $(o, a)_i$, where $o$ denotes an observation and $a$ indicates the action taken by the expert in response to that observation. You must simply learn to imitate the expert, a process also known as behavioral cloning. If the action space is discrete, behavioral cloning becomes a classification problem; if it's continuous, it turns into a regression problem. We will be working on an environment that has a discrete action space. Consequently, we can treat behavioral cloning as a classification problem with three output classes: go up, go left, and go right.\n",

        "In *Part 2*, the observation will be the agent's ground truth position within the maze's coordinate system. The training data will consist of tuples $(o, a)_i$  where $o$ represents the agent's location in the maze, and $a$ is the action taken by the expert at that location. You may use any classification method from Scikit-learn to learn the mapping from these observations to the corresponding actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will need to implement the class *POSBCRobot()*. The methods to implement are documented below. We will evaluate your model by having the robot execute the commands generated by your policy, or in other words, by \"rolling out your policy\" in the environment. After 20 steps, we will compute how close the robot gets to the goal. Formally, the score for a single run will be calculated based on the minimum distance between your agent and the target location achieved over a trajectory of 100 steps. We will run your agent 20 times in the environment and use the following formula to calculate your score:\n",
